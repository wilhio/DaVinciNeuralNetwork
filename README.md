# Fibonacci-Based Differential Energy Engine

## Overview
This project is a complex simulation that combines numerical sequences, physical models, signal processing, and visualizations to explore the conceptual mechanics of a differential energy engine driven by Fibonacci patterns. It features multi-modal energy modeling through mechanical, thermal, and quantum-inspired systems.

## Key Features
- **Fibonacci-Driven Simulation**: Utilizes Fibonacci sequences and digital roots to create energy interaction patterns and waveform simulations.
- **Energy Modeling**: Includes standard, advanced, and differential energy strengthening factors.
- **Hilbert Transform**: Applies analytic signal processing to identify phase shifts and amplitude envelopes.
- **Hypervector Encoding**: Simulates high-dimensional encoding and interaction patterns using random projections.
- **Quantum & Particle Models**: Builds quantum-like particles from Fibonacci data and tracks trajectory and energy changes.
- **Iterative Enhancement**: Simulates energy accumulation and interaction across multiple cycles and iterations.
